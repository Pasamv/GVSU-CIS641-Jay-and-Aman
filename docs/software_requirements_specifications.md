# Overview
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the recipe-sharing platform project. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for stakeholders, including developers, designers, and project managers, detailing the functionalities and performance criteria necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the system.

# Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication**
    1. The platform shall allow users to register using an email address, Google, or Facebook accounts.
    2. The platform shall enable registered users to log in and log out securely.
